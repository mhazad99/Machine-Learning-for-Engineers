- To read the .ipynb file you only nead to have the datasets on your google drive in a 
  same directory as the code file. Then you need to change these two lines of code that
  comes as following to your directory path:
		
	# read data
	Train_df = pd.read_csv('DIRECTORY OF THE TRAINING DATA ON YOUR DRIVE')
	Test_df = pd.read_csv('DIRECTORY OF THE TEST DATA ON YOUR DRIVE')

    * After changing these two directories in the code, now the life becomes easier and you can run
      the entire code on the google colab or other IDE that you prefer!

- The next steps are as easy as it takes. You need to run the code from the up to down and observe
  the reported results. Besides, you can see the required comments near each line of the code to 
  help you better understand our code!



  Thanks for your attention!
